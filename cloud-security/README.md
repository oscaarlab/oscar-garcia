# ☁️ Cloud Security

This section contains hands-on labs focused on securing cloud environments, primarily in Azure.

The work here is centered on identity, access control, secure configurations, and visibility across cloud resources, with scenarios aligned to **banking and regulated environments**.

---

### What You’ll Find Here

- Identity & Access Management (IAM / RBAC)
- Resource access control
- Secure cloud configurations
- Logging and monitoring
- Secrets management

---

### Lab Focus

These labs are designed to reflect how cloud resources are secured in environments where:

- access must be tightly controlled
- actions must be traceable
- sensitive information must be protected
- cloud configurations must follow security best practices

---

### Environment Context

All labs are approached with a **banking and regulated environment mindset**, where identity boundaries, auditability, and secure access are critical.

Work is developed and tested in **controlled environments** to keep implementations safe, reproducible, and practical.

---

### Current Direction

This section is being built around Azure-based security implementations such as:

- IAM / RBAC
- secure access to resources
- monitoring and visibility
- secrets protection
